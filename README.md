# ClassicModTool
A Level/Sprite Editor for Celeste Classic (WIP)

Try to use this to edit copies of carts (or have backups of it), no idea if it could do anything bad to the cart somehow (though it should work fine from what I tested).

## Useful Shortcuts

- Ctrl+S to Save
- Ctrl+Z to Undo
- Ctrl+R to Reload External Changes

- Shift+S to toggle selecting, which only copies tiles for now.
- While pasting selected tiles, holding Shift will allow you to paste multiple times.
- While autotiling, holding shift will make the tiles only autotile with eachother.
- Arrow Keys to go Back/Forward through levels.
